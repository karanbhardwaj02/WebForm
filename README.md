Project Title: Student Form
Project Description:
This project is a Student Form designed to capture and manage student information. The form collects and stores student data into the STUDENT-TABLE of the SCHOOL-DB database. It uses JsonPowerDB (JPDB) as the backend database to ensure fast, efficient, and reliable storage and retrieval of student records.

Input Fields:
The form includes the following fields for user input:

Roll No – A unique identifier for each student (Primary Key)

Full Name – The complete name of the student

Class – The academic class or grade of the student

Birth Date – The student's date of birth

Address – The residential address of the student

Enrollment Date – The date the student is officially enrolled

These fields help to maintain a detailed and structured student profile.

Primary Key:
Roll No is used as the Primary Key, which ensures each student entry is unique and helps in easy identification and retrieval of records.
